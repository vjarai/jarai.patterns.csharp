# Strategy

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Frequency of use: high

The UML class diagram for the Strategy pattern is the same as the diagram for the Bridge pattern.
However, these two design patterns aren't the same in their intent.
While the Strategy pattern is meant for behavior, the Bridge pattern is meant for structure.

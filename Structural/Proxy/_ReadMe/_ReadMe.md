# Proxy

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Although decorators can have similar implementations as proxies, decorators have a different purpose.
A decorator adds one or more responsibilities to an object, whereas a proxy controls access to an object.

Frequency of use: medium-high

## Proxy Examples:

* Access control (protection proxy).
* Local access to a remote service (remote proxy).
* Caching request results (caching proxy).
* Lazy initialization (virtual proxy).
* Smart reference (smart pointer).
